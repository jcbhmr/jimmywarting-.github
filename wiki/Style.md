Rule #1: **Existing project conventions trump everything.** If there's an
existing well-understood way of doing things, it's a very good idea to do it
that way so that everyone understands it. A good example is Python's `self`
parameter in methods. Maybe it should be `this` to align with JavaScript, Java,
and C++. But it's not. Thus, you should use `self`. 🤷‍♂️

That Rule #1 also applies to folder conventions too! If `test/` is more popular
than `tests/`, I'd use `test/`. If you're curious, check [GitHub Search] to
conduct a popular vote of existing GitHub projects.

## File naming convention

As a fallback, I like to use `kebab-case`. It's [recommended by Google] over
underscores. However, my first choice is to **name the file after it's exports**
or whatever export-equivalent construct exists in the language of your choice.

```js
// myFunction.js
export default function myFunction() {}
```

```py
# do_thing.py
def do_thing():
  pass
```

This helps encourage breaking things into multiple files. I like this because:

1. You split more stuff up with explicit dependencies instead of a single file
   with spaghetti.
2. You can find the function that you want to edit faster. Having a quick
   os-native code tree (the file explorer) is nice!
3. When glancing at diffs or PRs, you can see "10 files changed" instead of "1
   file changed" and get a decent gist of how far-reaching a change is.

## Markdown

### Redundant headings

Wherever possible, I like to omit the `<h1>` title of a Markdown document and
rely on the title of either the file or the generated `<title>` or `<h1>` (like
in a GitHub wiki) to set the title. This avoids repeating the same information
twice. This is particularily useful advice for GitHub wiki pages where they get
an extra `<h1>` generated by GitHub based on the file name.

### Link style

When writing prose, I like to use the `[term]` external link definition pattern.
This approach offers the advantages of:

1. Not needing to define a link's href right away.
2. Not needing to think of a short ID like `[term][term-id]` since you are using
   `[term]` as its own ID.

But, it does offer one sole disadvantage (also shared with `[term][term-id]`):
Resolving `[term]` to an href takes longer than `[term](href)`

This particular style fits with the way I write Markdown. I write in prose for a
short sprint, and then come back with GitHub Copilot at the bottom of the file
to generate the `[term]: https://` prefixes that I need. Then, I just add in the
URLs and 💥 POW! I'm done!

This also lessens the `problem][with-long-tokens]` because that 👈 is
interpreted as one single "word" and will wrap as such:

```md
I hope that you have enjoyed this! Our [HTML
Specification-v2.0][whatwg-html-v2.0] is not yet ready for the prime time, so
try to be patient with us as we make sure that it meets all the necessary
```
